	Properties of Epoch-change
		EC1: Monotonicity: If a correct process starts an epoch (ts,l) and later starts
			an epoch (ts',l'), then ts' > ts.
		EC2: Consistency: If a correct process starts an epoch (ts,l) and another correct
			process starts an epoch (ts',l') with ts = ts', then l = l'.
		EC3: Eventual leadership: There is a time after which every correct process has
			started some epoch and starts no further epoch, such that the last epoch
			started at every correct process is epoch (ts,l) and process l is correct.

/*
	Every process p maintains two timestamps: a timestamp lastts of the last epoch that is
	started (i.d., for which it triggered a <StartEpoch> event), and the timestamp ts of
	the last epoch that is attempted to start with itself as leader (i.e., for which it
	broadcast a NEWEPOCH message).
	Initially, the process sets ts to its rank. Whenever the leader detector subsequently
	makes p trust itself, p adds N to ts and sends a NEWEPOCH message with ts.
